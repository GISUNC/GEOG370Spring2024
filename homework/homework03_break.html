<h3>Create a map using three world projections and discuss how the proejction distorts 

    Instructions: Find a large human made construction South of the Equator that does not have a rectangular shape. Vectorize the building as a polygon and as a point. Export the polygon and point as a GeoJSON in WGS84 and in UTM. 
    <br> Make a report in PDF the includes in page 1 your name, the name of the building, and a map that contains a word map using an Orthographic projection and the point showing the location of the building. Use the following data for creating the orthographic projection. You need to create the projection so it is centered in the location of the waypoint. 
    <br> Add the text of the orthographic projection and highlight in yellow coordinates that you used as the center of the projection. 

    <br> The second page should contain a map at a finer scale where you can see the polygon that you vectorized over the ESRI tileset. This map needs to have a scale.  
    <br> Under the map include a text with the information from the Geojson in UTM of the building. 
    <br> Explain in your own words the UTM zone that you used and why.
