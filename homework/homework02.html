<h3>GET DATA FROM A GPS APP and make a map of a track.
    You should be able to see the track over a maptile of open street map. Use the GAIA gps on a safe open space and walk in a way that you can create a track with your name. If your name is to complex try creating your initials.  
    The track should be data from a place that you walked that you are willing to share. The track needs to be based on a least 5 min of movement. 


  
<!-- <ul><li>The map should contain a vector obtained from the internet and a background raster (it can be a tile layer). 
</li></ul>
<ul><li>The map should also have a point, a line and a polygon digitized by the student in WGS84. The point, line and polygon should have a readable attribute displayed in the map. </li></ul>
<ul><li>The map should also have a title and a legend. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Export the map as a PNG.</li></ul> -->
