<h3>Georeference a historical image from USGS Earth Explorer</h3>

    <li>Watch the <a href="../pages/section3.html">tutorial videos</a> on how to georeference an image, download an image from USGS Earth Explorer</li>
    <li>Select an areal photo single frame at a scale larger than 1:30,000 from an area of interest (besides Chapel Hill).  You should be interested in seeing how this area has changed through time.</li>
    <li>Georeference the historical image that you selected, for this hw it will be ok to use the ESRI tileset as the reference, however that is usually not the ideal. </li>
    <li>Save a control point layer with at least 6 control points.</li>
    <!-- <li>Make a tile layer from the georeferenced image.</li> -->
    <!-- <li>You will turn in the link to your tile map and a link to your control points before the deadline</li> -->
</ul>
